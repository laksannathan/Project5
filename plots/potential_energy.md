x-axis: time in picoseconds
y-axis: potential energy in kilojoule per mol
As we slowly decrease the temperature the system is losing kinetic energy. Due to the decrease of energy in the system, the potential energy also decreases.
The potential energy of atoms at higher temperatures is stored by electrons in excited states, additionally at higher temperatures more atoms are in excited rotationally states. [citation needed]
Also the virial theorem specifies, that the potential energy and the kinetic energy in a system are depend on each other. [citation needed]
