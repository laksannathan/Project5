x-axis: time in picoseconds
y-axis: potential energy in kilojoule
By increasing the tempreature of the system, the potential energy is rising. The thermostat fixes the kinetic energy, which can lead to a loss of potential energy (which can be seen in this plot). Particles can be accelerated or slowed down by the thermostat.
