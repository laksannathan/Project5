\section{Introduction to Molecular Dynamics Simulations}

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method for studying atoms and molecules in motion ~\cite{Gonzalez}. Following the laws of classical mechanics, i.e. numerically solving Newton's 2nd law (\ref{eq:2nd law}), MD simulations allow insights into trajectories for each atom \(i\) in a system constituted by \(N\) atoms. Forces between the particles and their potential energies are calculated using force fields.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2nd law}
F_i = m_i a_i.
\end{equation} %  this commented blank line prevents start of a new paragraph
Here, \(m_i\) is the atom mass, \(a_i = \frac{d^{2}r_i}{d^{2}t}\) its acceleration, and \(F_i\) the force acting upon it, due to the interactions with other atoms.

Since molecular systems typically consist of a large number of particles, it is impossible to analytically determine the properties of such complex systems; MD simulation avoids this problem by using numerical methods. However, long MD simulations are mathematically ill-conditioned and produce cumulative errors in numerical integration. Proper selection of algorithms and parameters can mitigate this problem, but not completely eliminate it.

When analytical solution of the mathematically defined problem is possible but it is time-consuming and the error of approximation we obtain with numerical solution is acceptable.

Numerical approach enables solution of a complex problem with a great number (but) of very simple operations.

\section{Experiments}

It is necessary to understand the dynamics of a noble gas in order to understand its function. We first present our methodology and thought process on the set up of such a MD simulation of argon atoms.

The system on which we conducted our simulations consisted of a simple single-atom particle enviroment, consisting of 100 and later of 216 atoms. Because of its inert state and single-atom nature (it does not create diatom structures as a gas or fluid) [tutorial], it prooves as a reliable candidate for the simulations where we only wanted to observe the dynamics of phase
transition, without any interference through molecule formation or dipolar interactions. The experiment consited of three parts:
The transition from the gas state to the liquid state, then back to the gas state, and finally from the liquid to the solid state.
The goal behind this was to observe the shift of potential energy thorughout the different transitions and its correlation
with the temperature within the system. We also calculated the radial distribution of the argon atoms throughout the various states and the diffusion constant.

\subsection{Methods}

As our system particle we used argon with 100 atoms for the transition from gas to liquid and back to gas, and 216 atoms for the transition from liquid to solid. Since the simulation was run on a single-atom system, the force-field, where the only relevant terms were the Pauli-Repulsion and London-dispersion, could be kept very simple. The Pauli-Repulsion describes the force that prevents atoms from overlapping[1], while the London-dispersion describes the effects of induced dipol-dipol interaction[2]. The simulations were done with Gromacs. To simulate the various transitions we adjusted the temperatures accordingly. To validate
the outcome of the phase transition we visualized the simulation with PyMol, where the observations confirmed our assumptions.
We then extracted the potential and temperature curves with the gromacs "energy" command. For the diffusion constant we used "gmsd", while the radial distribution was calculated using "grdf". The plots were created with "xmgrace".

\subsection{Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Question: What is the calculated diffusion constant? How does it compare to the experimental value of 2.43 times 10-5 cm2 div s?
    \item  Question: What is the nearest-neighbor distance for two argon molecules? Why is the second-neighbor peak not exactly at twice the nearest-neighbor distance?
\end{itemize}

In the annealing simulations, we have not only observed the condensation to the liquid phase, but at lower temperatures also the freezing towards the solid phase. To concentrate on this phase transition more explicitly, we are now going to simulate the condensed phase. A simulation box has already been prepared. Download liquid.gro, and 94k.mdp to your local working directory. Update your topology (argon.top) and change the number of atoms (last line) from 100 to 216. Start the simulation of liquid argon with:
grompp -f 94k.mdp -c liquid.gro -p argon.top -maxwarn 2
mdrun -v -c liquid.pdb -nice 0. To analyse the dynamic behaviour of liquid argon, we willll calculate the diffusion constant from the simulation. The Einstein formula can be used, which relates the mean atomic displacement to the diffusion constant. For this, we'll use the program gmsd:
gmsd -s -f traj.xtc -trestart 50 -b 100
The option '-trestart 50' means that time windows of 50 ps are used for the analysis (to enhance the statistics), and '-b 100' means that the first 100 ps are excluded from analysis. Select '0' or '1' when asked for a group.

DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT (CONSTANT).: the quantity of a substance that in diffusing from one region to another passes through each unit of cross section per unit of time when the volume-concentration gradient is unity —called also diffusivity.
DIFFUSION:
Movement of a fluid from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Diffusion is a result of the kinetic properties of particles of matter. The particles will mix until they are evenly distributed

The potential energy of atoms at higher temperatures is stored by electrons in excited states, additionally at higher temperatures more atoms are in excited rotationally states. [citation needed]
Also the virial theorem specifies, that the potential energy and the kinetic energy in a system are depend on each other. [citation needed]}
